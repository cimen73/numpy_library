<p>NumPy is a library in the Python programming language that helps us work with multidimensional arrays and matrices, allowing us to perform advanced mathematical operations. Nowadays, Numpy is a library that is frequently used by Python programmers, especially those working on data science.</p>
    
<p>It is used to perform mathematical, algebraic and statistical operations on indexes.</p>

<p>One of Numpy's advantages over other libraries is that it has functions that allow us to operate with multidimensional arrays.</p>

<p>Let's remember multidimensional arrays:</p>

<H3>List usage: </H3>

a = [1,5,10]
b = [1,2,3]

a * b => ERROR !

<H3>Using NumPy: </H3>

a = numpy.array([1,5,10])
    
b = numpy.array([1,2,3])

a * b = numpy.array([1,10,30])
